  <span class="post-date">2019-10-29</span>
  <p>My friend,</p>
<p>Sometimes I see you reading in the grass. <br/>
I see you splayed out beneath the fire-white sky, like the petals of a flower, or a new-broken window, <br/>
refracting fractals of  light and shadow and brutal, breaking, broken edges and edges and <br/>
edges on end, the end. <br/></p>
<p>Fuck that. I’m a liar, and you know the endings I have told. You <br/>
don’t end with edges, don’t end <br/>
with broken, don’t end with your legs carrying you <br/>
to the door. <br/></p>
<p>Friend, your jagged tongue comes from somewhere, <br/>
from eyes that see into the bottoms of things: <br/>
the cat’s belly, the gritty pond, the cobblestone, dust and ashes <br/></p>
<p>The world’s another strip of life-hatched <br/>
leather for you to stitch into <br/>
something beautiful. I see the lines it <br/>
forms beneath your fingers, threads of rocks and rivers, blinding <br/>
for a second in the setting of the sun. <br/></p>
<p>I see the ragged endings tucked away. <br/></p>
<p>‘Cause friend, you cannot fix the world by shouting <br/>
at its bent-up bits and pieces, peace <br/>
is no dove, nothing light, my love; nothing <br/>
to fit on your shoulder and sing with you <br/>
not in your voice, not every time. <br/></p>
<p>You, a storm in the desert, a mighty <br/>
redwood among the plastic palm trees <br/>
sometimes it’s braver to touch the Earth <br/>
again. Sometimes it’s braver to arm yourself with someone else’s noise. <br/></p>
<p>I ask the impossible, I know, I know... <br/>
I know I don’t. I can’t. <br/>
The world has fed me roses and <br/>
it has fed you broken glass. But <br/>
my friend, I will boomerang you a smile; I will wrap up your scraped knuckles with crackling-thin hope; I <br/>
will pour my quiet, my waiting, my different kind <br/>
of crying on the burning, burned-up places. I <br/>
cannot be the avenging angel curled inside your splintered altar but I can be a soft place for your knees. <br/></p>
<p>I can let you rest. </p>
