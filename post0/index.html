  <span class="post-date">2019-10-29</span>
  <p>My friend,</p>
<p>Sometimes I see you reading in the grass.
I see you splayed out beneath the fire-white sky, like the petals of a flower, or a new-broken window, refracting fractals of light and shadow and brutal, breaking, broken edges and edges and edges on end, the end.</p>
<p>Fuck that. I’m a liar, and you know the endings I have told. You 
don’t end with edges, don’t end
with broken, don’t end with your legs carrying you 
to the door.</p>
<p>Friend, your jagged tongue comes from somewhere,
from eyes that see into the bottoms of things: 
the cat’s belly, the gritty pond, the cobblestone, dust and ashes</p>
<p>The world’s another strip of life-hatched
leather for you to stitch into
something beautiful. I see the lines it 
forms beneath your fingers, threads of rocks and rivers, blinding
for a second in the setting of the sun.</p>
<p>I see the ragged endings tucked away.</p>
<p>‘Cause friend, you cannot fix the world by shouting 
at its bent-up bits and pieces, peace 
is no dove, nothing light, my love; nothing 
to fit on your shoulder and sing with you
not in your voice, not every time.</p>
<p>You, a storm in the desert, a mighty 
redwood among the plastic palm trees
sometimes it’s braver to touch the Earth 
again. Sometimes it’s braver to arm yourself with someone else’s noise.</p>
<p>I ask the impossible, I know, I know...
I know I don’t. I can’t. 
The world has fed me roses and
it has fed you broken glass. but 
my friend, I will boomerang you a smile; I will wrap up your scraped knuckles with crackling-thin hope; I 
will pour my quiet, my waiting, my different kind
of crying on the burning, burned-up places. I
cannot be the avenging angel curled inside your splintered altar but I can be a soft place for your knees. </p>
<p>I can let you rest.</p>
