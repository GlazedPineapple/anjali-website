  <p>With less of a howl than a deathbed whisper, an icy wind passes over Elliot’s sleeping form, rustling the hairs at the nape of their neck and leaving a trail of goosebumps along their moon-washed skin. They stir a little and nestle deeper into their tangled mass of blankets, their arms tightening around the star-streaked, softest one, their lanky legs folding up closer to their stuttering heart. The watery moonlight makes their face shine like a silver coin turned on its edge, waiting for gravity, waiting for something. But still Elliot sleeps.</p>
<p>In this big house, filled with corners and crannies, with rooms left empty or stained with memory, with the hummings of computers and the clawings of cats, with shadows, there are some things that do not sleep. Against the closed windows and snugly shut doors, the wind presses, just a thread of chill, but an insistent one. And it always circles back to Elliot’s room, brushing their curled fingers, rasping secrets against their ears.</p>
<p>Sometimes the wind isn’t a wind. Sometimes the shapes it traces become strands of hair, a cool breath, the memory of running feet. Sometimes if someone were watching (although no one ever is) from the corner of their eye, they might see a boy perched on the edge of a windowsill.</p>
<p>The boy had a name, once, but now it matters little. He has been here a long time. In this big house there have been big sadnesses. There have been little boys who slept and never woke.</p>
<p>The boy has lost his name, but he has a name for Elliot: Little Sibling. Ever since the day they set foot into his old room, a ten-year-old with big blue eyes and tufts of tawny hair peeking out from under a baseball cap, the boy has watched them, seeing echoes of a half-forgotten brother in the shape of their shoulders, of a half-forgotten sister in the curve of their face. </p>
<p>He has followed them around the house, at first rustling about as they read Warriors books and studied servers, peering over their shoulder as their fingers closed around their first sweet, sweet raspberry pi. He has watched through the window as they walked toward the river in their backyard, first with a mother and a life jacket and then with nothing and no one, and stared at the sky as they dreamed of flying again. He scared Skipper once or twice, and cooed unheard in soft apology, and has scattered dust away from a few books in the library. He has explored every corner of the big house, from the bean bagged book nook to the boxes in the basement.</p>
<p>His Little Sibling has grown up now, but young ghosts still become ancient things. And so every night he still guards their sleeping shape and touches their moonlit hair.</p>
<p>He knows they won’t live there forever. Other boys and girls and people in between have passed through before and will again.</p>
<p>But deep in his cold dead heart, Elliot, the teenager with the head full of wires and the hands full of keys, with their dog in their lap and their headphones on their neck, now asleep and breathing softly into their starlit dreams, is the one that will always be his.</p>
