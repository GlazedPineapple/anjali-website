  <p>My mother said I was born angry. <br/>
She said I came out hungry, too, two <br/>
eyes like pinwheels spinning into nothing, spinning <br/>
empty fairground rides, tunnels of dark, tunnels <br/>
into the deep inside her, the deep <br/>
where I had clung when there was nothing left to fill me. <br/></p>
<p>I came out small, too early, face pinched <br/>
like that of an old lady too world-weathered to cry. <br/>
I did not cry. <br/></p>
<p>She held me in a blanket, swaddled, swallowed  <br/>
whole. And we were hungry, she and I, and <br/>
the world was hungry too and she knew, she  <br/>
knew the small and skinny precious thing I was  <br/>
to her, yellow like gold, sharp like rain. <br/></p>
