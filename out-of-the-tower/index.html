  <h1 class="post-title">Out of the Tower</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2020-02-05</span>
  <p><em>Once upon a time, there was a hill, with a tall tower at the top and a tangle of a forest at the bottom. In the tall tower was a princess with a dark river of hair and eyes like  stained glass windows. In the forest were trees and soft shadows and flowers that smelled of saffron and the stars. <br/></p>
<p>The princess, like most princesses, spent her days within the tower’s walls, smiling and feasting and dancing, seeing the world from a window that made it beautiful and terrible and small. Unlike most princesses, she was not a girl at all, but a changeling, a gift from the shadows of the forest. They had fashioned her out of little twigs and painted bark and flower stems and good solid oak. They had laid her in the royal cradle, threading wisps of shadow songs into her hair. They had stolen away the way they came. Now no one knew, of course, not even the changeling princess because they had charmed her so well. But still, the trees stretched out their limbs to the sky, waiting for her to come home. And the shadows of a forest run deeper than its roots and rivers. <br/></p>
<p>One day, a shadow broke from the forest and became a sparrow. He perched on the window of the princess’ tower. She fed him breadcrumbs as a good princess does, and wished he would go away. <br/></p>
<p>“Come with me,” sang the sparrow. <br/></p>
<p>“Why?” said the girl. <br/></p>
<p>“You are a wooden girl in a tall tower. You come from the trees, and to the trees you shall return.” <br/></p>
<p>Something shifted inside her, a tug and an ache and the settling of weight. “Will the trees ever give me back?” <br/></p>
<p>“Mostly.” <br/></p>
<p>The princess nodded, unfolded the smile she kept in her back pocket, grasped the sparrow’s tail, and let him bear her into the sky and down the hill, into the arms of the trees. <br/></p>
<p>The earth beneath her beckoned, so she kicked off her dancing shoes and squeezed the moss between her toes. She traced the bark of her mother trees and the veins of the leaves that mirrored her own. She felt her oak legs shift and carry her more surely than they ever had before. The rivers filled her hands with sweet water and fruits that  tasted like the dappled sunlight between branches. Home, murmured the wild beasts and birds and shadows. Home, murmured her wooden heart beneath her breathing shape. <br/></p>
<p>But she soon found that not all the paths of the forest were for her feet. Every time she made a turn too deep, a tree scooped her up in its branches and placed her back on the path it had laid out for her, strewn with flower petals and smooth, round stones. <br/></p>
<p>“I want to know you,” said the princess, but the forest only pressed more roses into her palms and held her tighter in its vine-tangled arms. Yet the shadows of a forest run deeper than its roots and rivers, and so she felt her shadow-sparrow’s feathers tickling her ear again. He sang all of the forest to sleep, all except the princess. Then he lead her into the forest’s heart. </em></p>
<hr />
<p>Once upon a time, I was a little girl who was getting less little every day. At twelve, my sister and I became aware of our status as the only girls at the Diwali party who hadn’t ever been to India. It didn’t much bother us - we connected to our heritage just fine via Slumdog Millionaire and microwave chicken tikka masala. Nevertheless, our family decided that we needed to set foot in the place where our father had spent twenty-one years of his life, where we had nine aunties and uncles waiting for us to come home. <br/></p>
<p>After months of planning and sixteen hours of sky, I breathed my first Indian air, the taste of of spices and moonlight. It was warm, even at 2 a.m. in February, and so were the arms of the aunties and uncles who had come to greet us. A giddy, swelling rush bubbled up inside me as we sped towards the hotel in a car on the other side of the road, the road painted with street light and shadow, my ears filling with lilting Hindi I didn’t need to understand. <br/></p>
<p>The days after were much the same. I saw the Red Fort and Taj Mahal, of course. I looked at sari fabrics at the market. I rode an elephant. I messed around in the hotel’s fancy glass elevator with the cousins, and devoured rotis fresh off the pan from the fingers of the aunties, who insisted I needed feeding. <br/></p>
<p>But there wasn’t only laughter in the streets. <br/></p>
<p>Every day our family braved the Indian traffic to see some new wonder of the city, we passed by lots of other cities that no one stopped to look at for so long. Tiny slums held up by cardboard and garbage and the scrawniest of hope. Laundry in bright reds and oranges dangling above the dust. Blade-boned people boxed in by shabby metal walls. <br/></p>
<p>Of course, every time a girl with an armful of flowers (or once, inexplicably, a teetering stack of copies of The Fault in Our Stars) tapped on the car window, my parents and aunties and uncles told me and my sister not to open up. There were too many of them, and if you gave one even a rupee, you’d have to help them all. You can’t know what they’d do. You can’t fix the world, not like that. <br/></p>
<p>I wasn’t naive enough to think my grownups heartless. <br/></p>
<p>Nevertheless, I did, just a little. <br/></p>
<p>And I thought myself more heartless still, as I drank cool bottled water from the car seat’s restraining embrace and imagined the bed I would return to that night, the omelette I would eat the next morning, each bite a flat and mechanical thing. Not a gift, not pure eggy gold. <br/></p>
<p>I didn’t have any money. I didn’t speak Hindi. I couldn’t fix the world, not like that. <br/>
But when I saw a young woman with a tattered red sari and a face like mine and a baby in her arms, begging for a scrap of mercy from our pockets outside of an ancient temple to some less-than-merciful god, the Indian nights tasted more like broken glass. <br/></p>
<hr />
<p><em> Once upon a time, there was a hill, with a tall tower at the top and a tangle of a forest at the bottom. In the tower had been an empty cradle, but no one remembered that anymore. In the forest, equally forgotten, was a girl, sleeping without sound in the branches of a great oak tree. A princess with a dark river of hair and eyes shuttered closed. A princess of breath, of blood, of bone. <br/></p>
<p>The wide-awake princess stared at the sleeper who shared her face. She fought against the wild thing snarling in her chest. <br> Silly girl. There can’t be a changeling without a change; she knew. But she couldn’t help but want to run away very far and very fast, because she didn’t want to know that she had stolen every sunset she’d seen framed in the tower’s window from this other girl’s closed eyes. She didn’t want to know that if it weren’t for her, there needn’t have been an empty cradle. <br/></p>
<p>She hated that this was coming home. <br/></p>
<p>She sank against the other princess’ tree, feeling the bark scrape into her back. She raked her fingers through her bramble-hair and felt a tear on her cheekbone like dew. She looked up at the shadows beneath the leaves above her. <br/></p>
<p>“Wake up!” she screamed, louder than she intended but not loud enough. “Come home!” <br/></p>
<p>The other princess did not stir. <br/></p>
<p>The oak tree’s bark offered no handholds. There were no strong branches tucked within its leaves. The soil hid no ropes or swords or magic rings. The shadows made no sound. <br/></p>
<p>A flesh-and-blood girl is too heavy to carry. <br/></p>
<p>And so the shadow princess blew her a kiss, with the truest love a stranger’s lips can hold. <br/></p>
<p>Then she followed the path out of the heart of the forest.</em></p>
