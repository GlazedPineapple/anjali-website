  <p>
It’s time to talk about the dead girl.<br/></p>
<p>
The one you’ve shoved <br/>
into a bathroom drawer <br/>
among the dental floss and never-used mascara <br/>
in the space <br/>
where the sharp edges used to be.<br/></p>
<p>
The one who sits crooked somewhere <br/>
beneath the flowered carpet <br/>
that has always sunk <br/>
its roots into the bedroom floor. <br/>
(Her bedroom floor.) The carpet <br/>
that our mother has since replaced <br/>
with something blue and earthless. <br/></p>
<p>
The dead girl told you <br/>
once <br/>
about that carpet <br/>
that used to be hers. <br/>
Sometimes she would lie on it, when <br/>
the blankness wedged in her <br/>
chest carved away <br/>
her steadiness. <br/></p>
<p>
She would stare up at her ceiling <br/>
with its strange adornments: <br/>
       the smear of battle-beaten moth. <br/>
       the air vent that never has blown air, just <br/>
       a square shaped collection <br/>
       of dust-choked cracks. <br/></p>
<p>
(It was November. A Friday night <br/>
the night you found her. <br/>
A Saturday <br/>
the day you told the first lie that would ever matter.) <br/></p>
<p>
More would follow. <br/>
You didn’t miss a day <br/>
of school <br/>
till spring. <br/></p>
<p>
And now it’s time to feel her, the dead girl.<br/></p>
<p>
(You remember her <br/>
don’t you <br/>
in the hospital bed. <br/>
She was small. <br/>
       She has always been small. <br/>
You stroked her hair, its shortness <br/>
devoid of spiked <br/>
defiance then, just softened <br/>
curls half-flattened <br/>
by some ambulance contraption. <br/>
You sang to her <br/>
of sunshine <br/>
low, off-key <br/></p>
<p>
but she felt like <br/>
she had already turned <br/>
to ice <br/>
or stone <br/>
or gold.) <br/></p>
<p>
Let’s talk about the dead girl.<br/></p> 
<p>
It’s time to unstring her <br/>
from the stars <br/>
where all the old gods <br/>
put the pretty things they’ve broken. <br/></p>
<p>
It’s time to plunge your hands <br/>
into the silt of some old pond <br/>
     you know the one <br/>
smash the toy boats <br/>
toy leaves <br/>
toy stones. <br/>
Hold something brackish, something <br/>
round and cold. <br/></p>
<p>
It’s time to wake the dead girl. <br/></p>
<p>
It’s time to pick her up <br/>
so gently <br/>
like a bird, or <br/>
like an egg, to <br/>
place a fluttering, <br/>
flickering <br/>
form <br/></p>
<p>
back into <br/>
her breathing shape. <br/></p>
