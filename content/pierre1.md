Darling, I almost remember when <br/>
the unhooked stars and sliced-up moon <br/>
were not enough to light you, when <br/>
the sky could fit inside your fist <br/>
or underneath your heel.

It hurt, I know, <i>I know,</i> to see <br/>
your face in every window and <br/>
cracks in every mirror and <br/>
bullets in anybody’s eyes. 

That someone would save you, <br/>
that the universe would save you <br/>
a seat— <br/>
you waited and waited <br/>
to come awake.

Nowhere to look but in, <br/>
darling. <br/>
Nothing to do but fall.
