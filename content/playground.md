My shadow has sat heavy in this place <br/>
that isn’t mine— 

on the swing set <br/>
with the creaking, shrieking chains <br/>
that bit my fingers, wild <br/>
things, as they filled <br/>
my mouth with sky,

on the slide <br/>
that I had long outgrown, <br/>
twisting like a lock of hair <br/>
or like a lie, that bright and <br/>
static-sprinkled <br/>
thing I’d lay upon <br/>
as I’d pretend to fall,

on the metal rock wall, <br/>
glinting coolly, a dragon <br/>
in a plaything’s shape, a <br/>
thing I mounted only once <br/>
and thought myself free

—and sits there, still, <br/>
the only old thing that remains.
