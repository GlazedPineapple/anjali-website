wild joy pressed between your fingers, the space <br/>
between your bones, alive, electric, a streak <br/>
of gleaming white speed about to begin <br/>
its becoming, <br/>

your beauty, soft lines painted by <br/>
the roughened scraps of twilight that <br/>
settled in the coolness of <br/>
the seats, <br/>

the rare and wondrous quiet daring, sharpening <br/>
the secret corners of your smile, <br/>

and loving you <br/>
is the easiest <br/>
thing i've <br/>
ever done. <br/>
