It’s cold out here. <br/>
It’s cold out here, and you are warm. <br/>

You are warm, your <br/>
softness, your solidity, your <br/>
burning fingertips <br/>
around me. <br/>

Your skin, bright like the <br/>
winter sky, blanketed gently <br/>
with new-fallen snow. <br/>
I trace your constellations. <br/>

Your eyes, threaded <br/>
with scraps of sky, <br/>
twilit, electric, <br/>
cloudless and kind: <br/>

you shimmer <br/>
like stardust, shine <br/>
like rain-polished, <br/>
streetlight-streaked <br/>
sidewalk, alive <br/>
in the dark, new <br/>
every time. <br/>

And the kiss: softer <br/>
than I expected, and <br/>
everything <br/>
is deep and dark and full with <br/>
the feel and scent and taste of <br/>
you, and <br/>
everything <br/>
is warm and <br/>
everything <br/>
is you. <br/>
