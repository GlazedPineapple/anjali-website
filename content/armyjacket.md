There will come a day <br/>
when a wire hanger will become <br/>
the bony pair of shoulders <br/>
that will bear <br/>
the worn-out weight of you. <br/>
It’s the weight of <br/>
a rope in the hangman’s hands <br/>
and also an embrace.

You will smell <br/>
like spiderwebs. <br/>
You will taste <br/>
like the tear <br/>
that landed <br/>
on the collar long ago <br/>
unfurling <br/>
into the whiskers
of dew-strung grass <br/>
my fingers chased <br/>
my lashes brushed

it’s quiet in its drying.

It lives in your zipper, <br/>
The stinging salt <br/>
of memory <br/>
the sun slathered <br/>
on the trees <br/>
and when I glimpsed <br/>
the fear in their laughter. <br/>
This weight.

It’s heavy and heady and <br/>
so are you and one day

we will rest.

For now <br/>
though <br/>
I’m your bony pair of shoulders <br/>
till even you <br/>
can’t hold them steady <br/>
when they tremble.
