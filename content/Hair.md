I see your <br/>
hair, peeking out from under your <br/>
hat, it makes me want <br/>
to slide my fingers into <br/>
its curls <br/>
where I know Iâ€™ll never <br/>
have to let go <br/>

hold you close to me <br/>
feel you run your fingers through my <br/>
hair, relish in this <br/>
closeness, this <br/>
symbiosis <br/>
my heart, is <br/>
yours <br/>
