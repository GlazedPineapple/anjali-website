I run my fingers along the jagged edges of your laugh. <br/>
I imagine the taste of it, pink-smeared, bittersweet, <br/>
like chocolate only used for making something else. <br/>

Your watch will drone its gleaming tick, <br/>
its face so cold and delicate, <br/>
filling your shape with whispers of weight. <br/>

But your hand is warm in mine, and I smell rain, <br/>
darling, thereâ€™s something growing.
