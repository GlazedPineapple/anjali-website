<i>what can i do <br/>
if i can’t wait for you?</i>

i was a traveler in an antique land. <br/>
you were a story that you told me.

like the sun, i used to touch your hair.

in the sandstorm of my <br/>
mind, you are a cracked and <br/>
crumbling Ozymandias, <br/>
ruined tyrant, just standing, just so <br/>
very still.

i’ve broken every fingernail on <br/>
your roughened, roughening <br/>
edges. i made you so beautiful, so <br/>
cold.
