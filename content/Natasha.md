You have imagined falling <br/>
in love a thousand times.

It should hurt, shouldn’t it, <br/>
like all falls do, a heart-shaped <br/>
bruise, breath snatched from lungs, <br/>
nothing easy, nothing soft.

But tonight, you think <br/>
just this, just <br/>
the hand in yours, just <br/>
the rain-polished pavement, just <br/>
the low sweet laughter, <br/>
<i>oh—</i>

maybe this is it, <br/>
darling. <br/>
This is where you land.
