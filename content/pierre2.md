It’s two a.m. and <br/>
you can’t see.

The skewed sheets cling <br/>
to your coiled legs, now <br/>
springing goosebumps <br/>
against the open window

(you just want <br/>
to smell the night).

<i>How can anyone sleep,</i> <br/>
you think. <br/>
<i>How can I go  <br/>
alone again. </i>

The dark is all <br/>
around you, enough <br/>
to drown, to swallow, and <br/>
you would be long devoured

were it not for that summer scent.

You feel a wide world <br/>
outside your window, <br/>
soon to be brightened, <br/>
soon to be yours,

so much bigger <br/>
than your hurt <br/>
could ever be.

Nowhere to look but up, <br/>
my love. <br/>
Nothing to do but stay.
