fingers on a keyboard <br/>
vocal chords forgotten <br/>
this is supposed to be <br/>
human? <br/>

a glaring screen <br/>
distorted sounds <br/>
this is supposed to replace <br/>
life? <br/>

where is the <br/>
Human <br/>
that I should be <br/>
surrounded with <br/>

where is the <br/>
Life <br/>
that Iâ€™m used to <br/>

fingers on hard metal <br/>
cold <br/>
where is the <br/>
Warmth <br/>
that comes with <br/>
Life <br/>
that is so <br/>
Human <br/>

where is it in this world?
