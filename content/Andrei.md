When you were twelve you decided <br/>
that you would believe in God.

It happened like this: 

sitting on the swingset you <br/>
felt you were too old for, you <br/>
felt the sunlight, sudden,<br/>
on your skin, and

the air smelled of the flowers <br/>
that hadn’t yet bloomed, and <br/>
the breeze tasted of August, <br/>
months away, and <br/>

the sky unfolded its warmth <br/>
upon your shoulders, and <br/>
your feet, brushing March mud, <br/>
seemed miles from the ground, and 

suddenly you wept your clumsy <br/>
twelve-year-old tears, <br/>
having caught a corner of a thing <br/>
so big and beautiful  <br/>
you couldn’t bear it.

This world could not belong to you <br/>
so you gave it to God <br/>
instead.
