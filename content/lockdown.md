So strange

That we sit here, seventeen and now <br/>
so used to quiet grief, <br/>
a ritual <br/>
no different from brushing <br/>
our teeth or feeding <br/>
the cats.

That we have to settle around <br/>
the empty places, arms awkwardly around <br/>
shadow shards and memories and <br/>
unbrushed wilding dust.

That we have to fill ourselves <br/>
right next to them.

That weâ€™re emptying all the same. <br/>
That it's all so quiet.
